**● Scientists are using AI to predict which coronavirus patients need ventilators**

The system analyzes a range of symptoms to identify at-risk patients. First, it will

analyze X-rays, tests, health records, and measurements of people who have

already finished treatment to identify the traits they have in common. They’ll then

collect the same data from newly hospitalized patients.

All of this data will be fed to a supercomputer, which will tell doctors when a new

patient will need a ventilator.[1][2]

● **COVID-19 X-Ray Images EDA + Models**

Exploratory Data Analysis indicates the critical process of conducting initial

investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot irregularities, to test

hypotheses and to check assumptions with the help of report statistics and

graphical representations. All COVID-19 patients are classified with the attribute

Label as Pneumonia. None of them is classified as normal. So the classification

model has zero False positives.[3]

demand for equipment like ICU beds and ventilators.

CPAS is based on a machine-learning system called [Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/progress-using-covid-19-patient-data-to-train-machine-learning-models-for-healthcare)[ ](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/progress-using-covid-19-patient-data-to-train-machine-learning-models-for-healthcare)[Adjutorium,](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/progress-using-covid-19-patient-data-to-train-machine-learning-models-for-healthcare)[ ](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/progress-using-covid-19-patient-data-to-train-machine-learning-models-for-healthcare)it has

already been used to develop insights into cardiovascular disease and cystic

fibrosis. The quality of the predictions generated by CPAS will depend on the

quality of the data submitted by each healthcare provider.[4][5]
