**● Scientists are using AI to predict which coronavirus patients need ventilators**

The system analyzes a range of symptoms to identify at-risk patients. First, it will analyze X-rays, tests, health records, and measurements of people who have already finished treatment to identify the traits they have in common. They’ll then collect the same data from newly hospitalized patients. 

All of this data will be fed to a supercomputer, which will tell doctors when a new patient will need a ventilator.[1][2]

● **COVID-19 X-Ray Images EDA + Models**

Exploratory Data Analysis indicates the critical process of conducting initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns, to spot irregularities, to test hypotheses and to check assumptions with the help of report statistics and graphical representations. All COVID-19 patients are classified with the attribute Label as Pneumonia. None of them is classified as normal. So the classification model has zero False positives.[3]

**● AI tool helps hospitals predict COVID-19 bed and ventilator demand**

The COVID-19 Capacity Planning and System (CPAS) is to demonstrate whether it can help the NHS predict the demand for equipment like ICU beds and ventilators.

CPAS is based on a machine-learning system called [Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/progress-using-covid-19-patient-data-to-train-machine-learning-models-for-healthcare)[ ](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/progress-using-covid-19-patient-data-to-train-machine-learning-models-for-healthcare)

It has already been used to develop insights into cardiovascular disease and cystic fibrosis. The quality of the predictions generated by CPAS will depend on the quality of the data submitted by each healthcare provider.[4][5]
